# BattleSquids
Revature Project 2

Team: Jason Zelonka, Do Yeun Kim, Muhammad Aown, Shaker Funkhouser

Ever wanted to play Battleship with your friends, but wished the game had more of a Cthulu-esque flavor? Well, welcome to BattleSquids! This is an evolution of Battleship where ships are squids that "ink" opposing squids.

Usage guide:
-Register an account, or log in to existing account
-Create a game by inviting a friend (by username), or accept an invite to a game
-Place your squids on your board (there are five types of varying sizes)
-When it's your turn, guess an enemy square to ink; if the tile is occupied by an enemy squid that tile will become utterly inked
-When all of the tiles occupied by your enemy's squids are inked, you win- unless your opponent inks all of your squids' tiles first

Technology Stack:
-AWS RDS server, with a PostgreSQL Engine
-Spring backend with Hibernate adapter and JDBC connection to db
-Spring MVC controllers
-Angular frontend
